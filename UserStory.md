Main User Stories:

Player Movement:
    As a player, I want to move my character in four directions (up, down, left, right) using keyboard controls, so I can freely navigate the game environment.

    Acceptance Criteria: The player should be able to smoothly move the character using the arrow keys or WASD keys.

Shooting Mechanic:
    As a player, I want to aim and shoot in multiple directions (e.g., using the mouse or fixed angles), so I can attack enemies coming from different sides.

    Acceptance Criteria: The player should be able to shoot projectiles, and they should follow the direction of the aim (e.g., based on mouse pointer or keyboard arrows).

Enemy Behavior:
    As a player, I want enemies to chase and attack me, so I have to stay alert and plan my movements.

    Acceptance Criteria: Enemies should have simple AI to follow the player, with varying behaviors (e.g., slow-moving enemies, fast enemies, ranged attackers).

Health System:
    As a player, I want a health bar that decreases when I get hit by enemies or obstacles, so I can see how much damage I’ve taken.

    Acceptance Criteria: The player character should have a visible health bar or indicator that decreases on damage, leading to game over when depleted.

Power-Ups:
    As a player, I want to pick up power-ups that temporarily boost my abilities, such as faster shooting or extra health, so I can survive longer and increase my chances of defeating enemies.

    Acceptance Criteria: Power-ups should appear randomly and provide effects like increased fire rate, extra life, or temporary invincibility.

Level Progression:
    As a player, I want the game to have multiple levels that become increasingly difficult, so I feel challenged as I progress through the game.

    Acceptance Criteria: The game should have distinct levels or waves of enemies, with difficulty scaling by increasing enemy count, speed, and health.

Score System:
    As a player, I want to earn points by defeating enemies, and I want my high scores to be saved, so I can see my improvement over time.

    Acceptance Criteria: A score should be visible during gameplay, with points awarded for each enemy defeated. The high score should be saved and displayed on a separate screen.

Game Over and Restart:
    As a player, I want a game-over screen when I lose all my health, and I want the ability to restart the game quickly, so I can try again without delays.

    Acceptance Criteria: A game-over screen should appear when the player’s health reaches zero, offering options to restart the game or exit.

User Interface (UI):
    As a player, I want a clean interface that displays my health, score, and any active power-ups, so I can keep track of my progress during the game.

    Acceptance Criteria: The UI should include a health bar, score counter, and icons or indicators for power-ups that the player has collected.

Sound and Effects:
    As a player, I want sound effects for shooting, enemy attacks, and background music, so the game feels more immersive and engaging.

    Acceptance Criteria: The game should include sound effects for various actions (e.g., shooting, enemy hits, power-up collection), and background music should play during gameplay with an option to mute.



Additional Stories:

Boss Fights:

    Acceptance Criteria: The game should introduce boss enemies with unique mechanics and higher difficulty at specific levels.
    
Different Weapons:
    As a player, I want to collect or unlock different types of weapons, such as shotguns or lasers, so I can adapt my playstyle and tackle enemies in different ways.

    Acceptance Criteria: The player should have access to multiple weapon types that alter the gameplay (e.g., spread shots, rapid fire, explosive projectiles).
    
Multiplayer Mode:
    As a player, I want to team up with friends and play co-op, so we can tackle enemies together and compete for the highest score.

    Acceptance Criteria: The game should allow two players to control characters simultaneously, with both players having individual health and score tracking.
